# Project 2: Fill in The Blanks Quiz
Intro to Programming Nanodegree

For this project, I built a Fill-in-the-Blanks quiz.
The quiz will prompt a user with a paragraph containing several blanks.
The user should then be asked to fill in each blank appropriately to complete the paragraph.
This can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary!

Example quiz:

    A ___1___ is created with the def keyword. You specify the inputs a ___1___ takes by adding ___2___ separated by commas between the parentheses. ___1___s by default return ___3___ if you don't specify the value to return. ___2___ can be standard data types such as string, number, dictionary, tuple, and ___4___ or can be more complicated such as objects and lambda functions.

The answer for `___1___` is 'function'. Can you figure out the others?

Run `fill-in-the-blanks.pyc` for a working version of the project.

## Code Review
1. **Use of Variables**: Your code should take advantage of variables and variable names should reflect the values they store.
2. **Functions:** Your code should use functions appropriately to avoid repetition. Function parameters should have logical names and should all be used in the body of the function.
3. **Appropriate use of Data:** Data types (strings vs lists for example) should be used appropriately.
4. **Appropriate use of other coding techniques:** Your code should use statements like if, then, else, while, etc... appropriately.
5. **Each function includes a comment:** Comments explain function behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable.)
